== Manually connecting to the internet:
sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
and then search for essid fields

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
and add at bottom:
network={
  ssid="holmes"
  psk="donttrythisathome"
}

maybe just reboot the pi and it will connect afterward

sudo wpa_cli reconfigure

== Installing WiringPi
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv

pip install wiringpi

TODO:
GET WIRING PI AND SOME OTHER SHIT ON HERE
TRY OUT BROADCASTING AN ADHOC NETWORK
dtoverlay=spi1-3cs



I reflashed the pi SD card with a fresh raspbian jessie
I then did a few basic setup things and then backed up the rpi sd card onto the desktop (so clone from that now)
I now have done the wiringPi setup from projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install
gpio spi load still fails

gcc -o spi_test spi_test.c -lwiringPi

to use andrews work, I had to install libssl-dev via apt-get install
